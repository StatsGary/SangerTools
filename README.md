## Package Aims 

This package has been created with the UK's National Health Service analytical workforce in mind; however we hope to aid analytical workers around to world in 
easy implementation of population health management techniques. 

The functions and included examples are created to mimic data found at NHS Gloucestershire CCG. Many of the functions are written in tidyverse.

The dataset included is random dataset generated based on proportions from Gloucestershire County; see vignette 

We have hope this package aids those working with 
* Patient Level Data
* Population Health Management
* Patient Cohorting
