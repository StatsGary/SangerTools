## Installing the package from GitHub

Here, I will use the package remotes to install the package:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes") # if not already installed
remotes::install_github("https://github.com/ald0405/SangerTools")
library(SangerTools)

```
## Installing the package from CRAN

Still a work in progress......
